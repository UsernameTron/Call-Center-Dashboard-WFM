- **Tailwind CSS 4.x** for responsive styling
- **Papa Parse 5.x** for CSV processing
- **Recharts 3.x** for data visualization
- **Lucide React** for icons

## üìä Supported Data Sources

The application processes 5 CSV file types:

### Required Files (Core Analytics)
1. **Agent Status Summary** - Time tracking and utilization data
2. **Agent Performance Summary** - Call handling metrics and KPIs  
3. **Training Interactions** - Individual call records with queue times

### Optional Files (Enhanced Analytics)
4. **Historical Adherence** - Schedule compliance and conformance data
5. **Calculated Time Summary** - Payroll and workforce planning data

## üßÆ Key Performance Indicators & Formulas

### Call Volume Metrics

**Total Calls Answered**
```
Œ£(Calls Answered across all agents)
```
*Sum of 'Answered' column from Agent Performance data*

**Transfer Rate**
```
(Total Calls Transferred √∑ Total Calls Answered) √ó 100
```
*Percentage of calls transferred to another agent*

**Abandonment Rate** 
```
(Abandoned Calls √∑ Total Interactions) √ó 100
```
*Percentage of calls abandoned by customers before being answered*

### Service Level Metrics

**Average Speed of Answer (ASA)**
```
Œ£(Queue Wait Time for answered calls) √∑ Number of Answered Calls
```
*Average queue time for calls that were answered (excludes abandoned calls)*
*Converted from HH:MM:SS format to seconds, displayed in minutes*

**Service Level Agreement (SLA) Thresholds**
```
Count(answered AND queue_time ‚â§ threshold) √∑ Count(answered) √ó 100
```
*Calculated for 30s, 60s, 90s thresholds*
*Percentage of answered calls handled within specified time limits*

### Handle Time Analysis

**Average Handle Time (AHT)**
```
Œ£(Talk Time + Hold Time + ACW Time) √∑ Number of Handled Calls
```
*Weighted average based on call volume per agent*
*Uses individual agent AHT weighted by their call volume*

**Handle Time Distribution**
- Under 5 min, 5-10 min, 10-15 min, 15-20 min, Over 20 min
- Categorizes agents by their average handle time performance

### Utilization Calculations

**Productive Utilization (Industry Standard)**
```
Œ£(Talk Time + Hold Time + ACW Time) √∑ Œ£(Agent Login Time) √ó 100
```
*Measures actual productive work time vs total logged time*
*Includes all customer-facing activities*

**On-Queue Utilization (Traditional)**
```
Œ£(On-Queue Time) √∑ Œ£(Agent Login Time) √ó 100  
```
*Traditional utilization showing time available for calls vs total logged time*
*Measures availability rather than productivity*

### Workforce Management

**Shrinkage Calculation**
```
(Break + Meal + Away + Not Responding + Off Queue) √∑ Logged In √ó 100
```
*Non-productive time as percentage of total logged time*
*Includes scheduled and unscheduled non-productive activities*

**Active Agents**
```
Count of agents with Logged In time > 0
```
*Agents who worked during the reporting period*

### Schedule Adherence (Optional)

**Adherence Percentage**
```
Time in correct scheduled state √∑ Total scheduled time √ó 100
```
*Percentage of time agents followed their scheduled activities*

**Conformance Percentage** 
```
Time in correct work state √∑ Total work time √ó 100
```
*Percentage of time agents were in correct state when working*

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **CSV Parsing** (`csvParser.js`)
   - Handles multiple CSV column name variations
   - Converts HH:MM:SS time formats to minutes/seconds
   - Filters out template records and invalid data
   - **Critical Fix**: Includes abandoned calls even without agent assignment

2. **Time Parsing Function**
   ```javascript
   parseTimeToMinutes(timeString) {
     // Converts "HH:MM:SS" to decimal minutes
     // Example: "01:30:00" ‚Üí 90.0 minutes
   }
   ```

3. **Data Analysis** (`dataAnalyzer.js`)
   - Processes all CSV data sources
   - Calculates weighted averages for performance metrics
   - Generates top/bottom performer rankings
   - **Enhanced**: Queue time distribution analysis for SLA validation

### Mathematical Validation

The system includes comprehensive validation to prevent impossible metric combinations:

- **ASA vs SLA Consistency**: High average speeds should correlate with low service level percentages
- **Time Accounting**: On-Queue + Shrinkage should not exceed Login Time  
- **Distribution Analysis**: Percentile calculations to identify data anomalies

### Queue Analysis

**Top 12 High-Volume Queues**
- Sorted by total call volume
- Color-coded abandonment rates (Green: <10%, Yellow: 10-15%, Red: >15%)
- Visual progress bars for abandonment rates
